## FAQ

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes. ImageMax processes all your photos **locally on your Mac**. No images are ever uploaded to any server.

**Q: Which model should I use?**
A: **Real-ESRGAN** is best for most photos. Use **CodeFormer** if you need to fix blurry faces.

**Q: Why is the file size large?**
A: ImageMax exports in lossless **PNG** format to preserve the highest possible quality after upscaling.
